# EndThatGame
EndThatGame is a python program designed to end game tasks running on a system when ran!
# Setup
Create a 'games.csv' file in the same directory as the program, open the file in a text editor and type one process name of a game you want to end per line. Example:
```
game1.exe
game2.exe
```
Once your games.csv file is ready simply open 'endthatgame.py' and it will end the game processes named in the games.csv file.
